            <h2>Why do you collect, use, and store my data?</h2>
            <p>There are several reasons!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>1. Giveaway entries</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>To make sure that no matter the method of entry, you get all the submissions you deserve! And
                            should you win, we need to know who to contact!</p>
                    </div>
                </li>

                    <h3>2. Simplify checkout process</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>So every time you finalize a purchase, you do not have to waste time re-filling your credit
                            card, shipping, and billing information! Also to ensure youâ€™re getting a giveaway entry per
                            $5 that you spent!</p>
